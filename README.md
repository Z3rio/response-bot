# Response Bot

This is just a bot that I created for my friend, if you wish to use it then
that's fine, although I will not be able to give any explicit support for it
sadly.

## Requirements

- NodeJS
- Something to host the bot on
- A brain

## Command list:

- /createautoreply
- /removeautoreply
- /autoreplylist

## Usage

Start out with installing the node modules with `npm install`.

Then copy the `.env.example` file, rename it to `.env` and input all the info
into it.

### Development

You can use `npm run dev` to run a development environment

### Start bot

You can start the bot using `npm run start`, but before that you would need to
build the bot with `npm run build`
